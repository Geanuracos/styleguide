# CityGrows Company and Team Communication Guidelines

All of our work at CityGrows is informed by our mission and our values.  If you’re not sure about how to address a situation, respond to something, or prioritize your activities, refer back to these foundational goals.  

**Mission:** CityGrows will transform and improve the way local government works.

**Vision:**  Through CityGrows, all local governments now have access to low-cost, effective tools that prioritize open data and transparency, while making government work better.  It’s as easy to track a business permit as a package, and that results in performance-based management and accountability. People feel more connected to government because government works better.  Government processes are faster, cheaper, and more flexible.

**Values:** CityGrows strives to be:
Transparent/ open (corporate processes as well as open data)
Collaborative/ Responsive/ communicative - empathize with and adapt to customer, team member, and community needs
Fair/ equitable - 
Iterative/ agile/ nimble
Data-driven and evaluative/ experimental
Fun
Compassionate/ kind
Positive/ optimistic
Reflective of our community
Interoperable
Accessible

## Communication style
### Tone

In our internal and external communications, our goal is to embody our values.  Our tone is positive, friendly, informative - we strive to never be condescending, snarky, or bad-tempered.  We are polite and express gratitude and appreciation frequently.  When we have to give critical feedback, we consider the potential tone and impact of our communication and seek to stress ways to improve and solve problems, rather than dwelling on negative aspects of internal or external dynamics.  That being said, we understand that difficult conversations and situations are an inevitable part of working closely together on ambitious goals, so we approach them with an atmosphere of respect and seek to create an atmosphere of psychological safety.  We value discussion, different opinions, and strong views expressed respectfully.  We call each other out when we need it, and most importantly we appreciate everyone’s work. If someone is being awesome, make sure they know it! 

### Content
It’s our goal to be consistent in the way we describe/ present CityGrows.  Text on our website is a good source of language to use to describe the company and product, and we will be creating talking points docs and other materials as needed to support outward communication.  Feel free to request or draft something for team review if you can’t find a description of something about the company or product already written.

### Grammar, Style and Text

Use good stylistic practices on grammar, formatting, and capitalization for anything that has a degree of permanence like formal documents, CRM tags, external emails, blog posts, etc. (as opposed to less permanent things like internal emails, Slack messages)
If you’re picking a font, consider using PT Sans (the font used on our platform). It’s okay if another font works better, but generally PT Sans is a more appropriate choice than another sans-serif body font like Arial.

### Specificity

When speaking about the product or technology to another team member, try to be as specific as possible. If you encounter a bug, don't say "I tried to launch a process and it didn't work." Instead, say, "I was logged in as an admin user and when I clicked 'Get started' from the admin side, I got an error message saying something went wrong."

## Communication tools

Try to avoid sending internal emails. Slack is almost always less disruptive and more effective.
For external communications, we’re guided by the methods that our clients prefer - so some clients may work best with phone calls, others with emails, etc.  Try and understand which methods which work best with each client.
Don’t be afraid to be persistent and pick up the phone.  Our short- and long-term success depends on growing our list of clients quickly.  We are respectfully and pleasantly persistent, because we’re offering an incredible and FREE set of tools to local governments.
Log all relevant external contacts in Prosperworks, so our monthly tracking reports are accurate.
Each client or potential client should have one main point of contact with CityGrows, with a few major exceptions (Santa Monica).  Check prosperworks before conducting any cold outreach to a new contact or following up with a warm contact to see if there is any existing history with that person or organization.
If you have something to share that you think the whole company would be interested in, but you don’t need a response from anyone, post it to team.citygro.ws
Email signatures should have your mobile phone number and the company twitter handle included


## Routine and communication strategy
### Standup Meetings
Standup meetings happen every morning @ 9:30 PST/
- Standup takes place in [this Appear In room](https://appear.in/citygrows)
- If you can make it, great, see you there!
- Don't rearrange your schedule for standup. If you cannot make it, don't worry about it. Just remember to:
  - Let us know not to wait for you
  - Share a text standup on Slack

### Retros
Retro happens at 3pm on Fridays in the same room as standup. During retro, we discuss things that happened over the past week
- What went well
- What needs improvement
- Action items

As with standup, if you are not able to make retro, please let the team know not to wait for you.

### Slack
As a remote-first company, Slack is really important in helping us communicate. Generally speaking, if you're working, you should have Slack open and available on both your computer and your phone. Just like in a physical office, your coworkers shouldn't have to wonder where you are or call you in order to share a piece of information or get a question answered.

We acknowledge though that messages and notifications are disruptive to flow, and so we ask that if you're working on something and prefer not to be interrupted, set yourself to away. That way everyone knows you're busy, but not MIA.

### Check-ins
Everyone should try and have at least one 1:1 conversation with your manager and/or an outside expert adviser each week.
We love hanging out and coworking in person, but we believe that our team can function effectively remotely.
Our team members are recruited because of their ability to work independently with integrity and effectiveness. We don’t track hours, we track deliverables. How and when you work s up to you, as long as deliverables are met in a timely manner and any potential issues, questions, or problems are promptly brought to the team’s attention.

### Signoff
Generally speaking, at least one other person should explicitly sign off on any significant decisions you make. That said, trust your instincts--waiting for the whole team to give approval for all decisions can be a real time sink.

## General dos and don'ts
Don’t assign “microtasks” to other people. It just makes everyone less productive.
BAD: “Hey did you book that meeting with Emily?” “No, I don’t have her email. Can you send it to me?”
GOOD: “Hey did you book that meeting with Emily?” “No, but I’m on it! Where can I find her email?”

## Our communication and management tools
We use many systems and tools to communicate and work productively - descriptions below are general guidelines.
Communication:
Email, Mailchimp - external communication
Slack, Google Hangouts- internal communication
Team blog - internal communication/ memorialized updates
Google group - communication with investors and advisers
Govtech blog, Medium, and social media accounts: Communication with the community

### File storage
- We use Google docs to collaborate on our short-term working docs, drafts, and personal work.
- We use Dropbox for all non-document files. (Things outside of the scope of Text documents, sheets, slides, etc)
- We use Keynote to create presentations, and Icloud to collaborate on them
- We use GitHub to store permanent documents (like this one) that will continue to evolve over time

Prosperworks - Sales and fundraising prospect tracking
Trello - Retro and ToDo's
Pivotal tracker - Development pipeline
